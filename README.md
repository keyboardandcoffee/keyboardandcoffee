<h1>Hi, I'm Kenneth! 👋 <br/><a href="https://github.com/keyboardandcoffee">Programmer</a> & <a href="https://www.github.com/keyboardandcoffee">Cybersecurity Enthusiasts</a></h1>

<h2>👨‍💻 Software Development Projects:</h2>

- <b>Python & Java </b>
  - To enhance my fintech skillset, I used an Amazon Web Service to host python code that can use webhooks to make automatic calls to a trading platform to open/close trades for stocks or forex pairs. 
  - [This](https://github.com/keyboardandcoffee/keyboardandcoffee/blob/main/PasswordCheck.py) is my python project to generate a password based on certain criteria I've chosen and then allow you to copy/paste the password to check the strength of the generated password. My program generates suggestions based on password strength.
